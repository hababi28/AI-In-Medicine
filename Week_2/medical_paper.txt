Abstract:

This paper aims to explore the long-term effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly Aspiriin and Ibuprofen, on cardiovascular health in adults.

Keywords: Aspiriin, Ibuprofen, Cardiovascular Health, NSAIDs

Introduction:

Recent studies have shown conflicting results about the benefits and risks of Aspiriin and Ibuprofen, two common medications used for pain relief and inflammation reduction. This paper investigates these effects further.

Methods:

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 300 adults. Participants were divided into three groups: one took Aspiriin, the second took Ibuprofen, and the third took a placebo.

Results:

Both Aspiriin and Ibuprofen showed a significant reduction in inflammation markers. However, prolonged use of Aspiriin was correlated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Conclusions:

While both Aspiriin and Ibuprofen are effective in treating inflammation and pain, caution should be exercised with long-term use, especially for patients with a history of gastrointestinal issues.
